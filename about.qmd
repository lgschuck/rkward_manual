# About RKWard

## [RKWard Mission statement](https://rkward.kde.org/RKWard_Overview.html)

**RKWard** is meant to become an easy to use, transparent frontend to the [R-language](http://r-project.org/), a very powerful,
yet hard-to-get-into scripting-language with a strong focus on statistic functions. It will not only
provide a convenient user-interface, however, but also take care of seamless integration with an office-suite.
Practical statistics is not just about calculating, after all, but also about documenting and ultimately
publishing the results.

**RKWard** then is (will be) something like a free replacement for commercial statistical packages.
In addition to ease of use, three aspects are particularily important:

-   It will be a transparent interface to the underlying R-language. That is, it will not hide the powerful
syntax, but merely provide a convenient way, in which both newbies and R-experts can accomplish most of their tasks.
A GUI can never provide an interface to the whole power of a language like R. In some cases users will want to
tweak some functions to their particular needs and esp. to automate some tasks. By making the “inner workings”
visible to the user, **RKWard** will make it easy for the user to see where and how to use R-syntax to accomplish their goals.

-   For the output, **RKWard** strives to separate content and design to a high degree. It will not try to design its
own tables/graphs, etc, which have to be converted to the style used in the rest of a publication by hand.
Currently **RKWard** uses HTML for its output. Using appropriate style definitions reformatting this output to
match the rest of the publication will be easily doable. In future releases **RKWard** will even seek stronger
integration with existing office suites.

-   It relies on a language, that is not only very powerful, but also extensible, and for which dozens of
extensions already exist.

**And of course, it is free (as in free speech).**

**Current status**

Perhaps the best way to get an impression of the current state of **RKWard** (other than installing and trying it)
is to have a look at the Screenshots. A status page focused on the internal components is here.

**In summary**:

**RKWard** currently offers a lot of useful features for developing R code. This functionality makes **RKWard**
highly useful as an IDE for R experts, today.
The number of graphical dialogs to give access to statistical functions is still rather limited.
Users coming from competing graphical statistics suites will find a lot is still missing, but possibly
the functionality you need most is already implemented in the growing number of plugins. Why don’t you
give it a try to find out? It is also possible to add your own dialogs as plugins (see Developer Information#Plugin developers).
As far as office integration is concerned, **RKWard** still has a long way to go. However, results are stored
to in HTML format, however, making it easy to copy-and-paste or import them into text-processing or other office tools.

## **RKWard** 0.7.5 - 24 Oct 2022

A new release, **RKWard** 0.7.5, is available for download, today.

The most visible changes are the inclusion of many new and improved code snippets,
and option to restart the R backend without leaving RKWard (this can be very useful
when trying to make sure that a script is fully reproducible), and various
improvements to code completion in scripts and the R Console.

As usual, we’re looking forward to your feedback suggestions, and contributions!

The changes in detail:

**New features and improvements**

-   Added: Partial completions (Tab-key) consider completion candidates from all visible completion groups
-   Added: R’s dynamic completions (importantly for “:::”, “?”, and “@”) are merged into the already provided completions
-   Added: Add option to offer code completion/hinting in all file types not just R scripts (e.g. in .Rmd files)
-   Changed default behavior (new installations, only): Up/down without alt navigate completion items if visible in console/editor
-   Added: Provide tooltips on symbols in scripts and R console
-   Added: Many new basic and advanced R, R Markdown and LaTeX snippets, including complete R Markdown templates
-   Added: Allow to select search provider, when searching for a term online
-   Added: Allow to restart R backend (e.g. for testing that scripts or packages will work in a fresh session)
-   Changed: Actions to restart the R backend, interrupt all commands and configure the R backend arranged in a hmburger menu
-   Added: Crosstabs N to N: Simplify labels, add option to control table layout
-   Added: Change mechanism for detection of object changes

**Bug fixes**

-   Fixed: Backend failed to start when installed in a path with spaces on Windows
volumes without 8.3 support
-   Fixed: Trying to restart backend could cause a hang, on Windows
-   Fixed: In corner cases, cancelling commands could lead to a lockup
-   Fixed: IRT Cronbach’s Alpha did not work for subsets, if the data.frame name contains dots
-   Fixed: Action to remove several rows in data editor, simultaneously, always remained disabled
-   Fixed: Workspace browser would not always show change, immediately, when object type changes
-   Fixed: Crash when using the “Git blame” kate plugin
-   Fixed: Problem installing R support package in some configurations
-   Fixed: Menubar would disapper after opening script editor, in some configurations
-   Fixed: Very long error messages during R markdown preview could cause the preview window to become too wide
-   Fixed: Expresssions spanning several lines would not be shown, correctly, in “R Console”-mode script preview
-   Fixed: Fix focus problems, and better efficiency for data previews (as used in data import dialogs)
-   Fixed: Excel import plugin failed to accept file name
-   Fixed: Fix zooming help/output pages with Ctrl+scroll wheel, when compiled with QWebEngine
-   Fixed: Fix problem handling rkward:// links from dialogs on some sytems
-   Fixed: Fix object name completion for (irregular) names starting with numbers or underscores
