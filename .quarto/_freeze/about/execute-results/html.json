It will not only\nprovide a convenient user-interface, however, but also take care of seamless integration with an office-suite.\nPractical statistics is not just about calculating, after all, but also about documenting and ultimately\npublishing the results.\n\n**RKWard** then is (will be) something like a free replacement for commercial statistical packages.\nIn addition to ease of use, three aspects are particularily important:\n\n-   It will be a transparent interface to the underlying R-language. That is, it will not hide the powerful\nsyntax, but merely provide a convenient way, in which both newbies and R-experts can accomplish most of their tasks.\nA GUI can never provide an interface to the whole power of a language like R. In some cases users will want to\ntweak some functions to their particular needs and esp. to automate some tasks. By making the “inner workings”\nvisible to the user, **RKWard** will make it easy for the user to see where and how to use R-syntax to accomplish their goals.\n\n-   For the output, **RKWard** strives to separate content and design to a high degree. It will not try to design its\nown tables/graphs, etc, which have to be converted to the style used in the rest of a publication by hand.\nCurrently **RKWard** uses HTML for its output. Using appropriate style definitions reformatting this output to\nmatch the rest of the publication will be easily doable. In future releases **RKWard** will even seek stronger\nintegration with existing office suites.\n\n-   It relies on a language, that is not only very powerful, but also extensible, and for which dozens of\nextensions already exist.\n\n**And of course, it is free (as in free speech).**\n\n**Current status**\n\nPerhaps the best way to get an impression of the current state of **RKWard** (other than installing and trying it)\nis to have a look at the Screenshots. A status page focused on the internal components is here.\n\n**In summary**:\n\n**RKWard** currently offers a lot of useful features for developing R code. This functionality makes **RKWard**\nhighly useful as an IDE for R experts, today.\nThe number of graphical dialogs to give access to statistical functions is still rather limited.\nUsers coming from competing graphical statistics suites will find a lot is still missing, but possibly\nthe functionality you need most is already implemented in the growing number of plugins. Why don’t you\ngive it a try to find out? It is also possible to add your own dialogs as plugins (see Developer Information#Plugin developers).\nAs far as office integration is concerned, **RKWard** still has a long way to go. However, results are stored\nto in HTML format, however, making it easy to copy-and-paste or import them into text-processing or other office tools.\n\n## About **RKWard**\n\n**RKWard** is developed by a community of volunteers.\n\n![About **RKWard**](images/about/about_rkward.png)\n\n![**RKWard** Components](images/about/about_components.png)\n\n![**RKWard** Authors](images/about/about_authors.png)\n\n## **RKWard** 0.7.5 - 24 Oct 2022\n\nA new release, **RKWard** 0.7.5, is available for download, today.\n\nThe most visible changes are the inclusion of many new and improved code snippets,\nand option to restart the R backend without leaving RKWard (this can be very useful\nwhen trying to make sure that a script is fully reproducible), and various\nimprovements to code completion in scripts and the R Console.\n\nAs usual, we’re looking forward to your feedback suggestions, and contributions!\n\nThe changes in detail:\n\n**New features and improvements**\n\n-   Added: Partial completions (Tab-key) consider completion candidates from all visible completion groups\n-   Added: R’s dynamic completions (importantly for “:::”, “?”, and “@”) are merged into the already provided completions\n-   Added: Add option to offer code completion/hinting in all file types not just R scripts (e.g. in .Rmd files)\n-   Changed default behavior (new installations, only): Up/down without alt navigate completion items if visible in console/editor\n-   Added: Provide tooltips on symbols in scripts and R console\n-   Added: Many new basic and advanced R, R Markdown and LaTeX snippets, including complete R Markdown templates\n-   Added: Allow to select search provider, when searching for a term online\n-   Added: Allow to restart R backend (e.g. for testing that scripts or packages will work in a fresh session)\n-   Changed: Actions to restart the R backend, interrupt all commands and configure the R backend arranged in a hmburger menu\n-   Added: Crosstabs N to N: Simplify labels, add option to control table layout\n-   Added: Change mechanism for detection of object changes\n\n**Bug fixes**\n\n-   Fixed: Backend failed to start when installed in a path with spaces on Windows\nvolumes without 8.3 support\n-   Fixed: Trying to restart backend could cause a hang, on Windows\n-   Fixed: In corner cases, cancelling commands could lead to a lockup\n-   Fixed: IRT Cronbach’s Alpha did not work for subsets, if the data.frame name contains dots\n-   Fixed: Action to remove several rows in data editor, simultaneously, always remained disabled\n-   Fixed: Workspace browser would not always show change, immediately, when object type changes\n-   Fixed: Crash when using the “Git blame” kate plugin\n-   Fixed: Problem installing R support package in some configurations\n-   Fixed: Menubar would disapper after opening script editor, in some configurations\n-   Fixed: Very long error messages during R markdown preview could cause the preview window to become too wide\n-   Fixed: Expresssions spanning several lines would not be shown, correctly, in “R Console”-mode script preview\n-   Fixed: Fix focus problems, and better efficiency for data previews (as used in data import dialogs)\n-   Fixed: Excel import plugin failed to accept file name\n-   Fixed: Fix zooming help/output pages with Ctrl+scroll wheel, when compiled with QWebEngine\n-   Fixed: Fix problem handling rkward:// links from dialogs on some sytems\n-   Fixed: Fix object name completion for (irregular) names starting with numbers or underscores\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLast update: 08/26/2023 - 15:00:01 -03\n",
