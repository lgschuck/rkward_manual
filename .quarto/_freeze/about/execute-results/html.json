It will not only\nprovide a convenient user-interface, however, but also take care of seamless integration with an office-suite.\nPractical statistics is not just about calculating, after all, but also about documenting and ultimately\npublishing the results.\n\n**RKWard** then is (will be) something like a free replacement for commercial statistical packages.\nIn addition to ease of use, three aspects are particularily important:\n\n-   It will be a transparent interface to the underlying R-language. That is, it will not hide the powerful\nsyntax, but merely provide a convenient way, in which both newbies and R-experts can accomplish most of their tasks.\nA GUI can never provide an interface to the whole power of a language like R. In some cases users will want to\ntweak some functions to their particular needs and esp. to automate some tasks. By making the “inner workings”\nvisible to the user, **RKWard** will make it easy for the user to see where and how to use R-syntax to accomplish their goals.\n\n-   For the output, **RKWard** strives to separate content and design to a high degree. It will not try to design its\nown tables/graphs, etc, which have to be converted to the style used in the rest of a publication by hand.\nCurrently **RKWard** uses HTML for its output. Using appropriate style definitions reformatting this output to\nmatch the rest of the publication will be easily doable. In future releases **RKWard** will even seek stronger\nintegration with existing office suites.\n\n-   It relies on a language, that is not only very powerful, but also extensible, and for which dozens of\nextensions already exist.\n\n**And of course, it is free (as in free speech).**\n\n**Current status**\n\nPerhaps the best way to get an impression of the current state of **RKWard** (other than installing and trying it)\nis to have a look at the Screenshots. A status page focused on the internal components is here.\n\n**In summary**:\n\n**RKWard** currently offers a lot of useful features for developing R code. This functionality makes **RKWard**\nhighly useful as an IDE for R experts, today.\nThe number of graphical dialogs to give access to statistical functions is still rather limited.\nUsers coming from competing graphical statistics suites will find a lot is still missing, but possibly\nthe functionality you need most is already implemented in the growing number of plugins. Why don’t you\ngive it a try to find out? It is also possible to add your own dialogs as plugins (see Developer Information#Plugin developers).\nAs far as office integration is concerned, **RKWard** still has a long way to go. However, results are stored\nto in HTML format, however, making it easy to copy-and-paste or import them into text-processing or other office tools.\n\n## About **RKWard**\n\n**RKWard** is developed by a community of volunteers.\n\n![About **RKWard**](images/about_rkward.png)\n\n![**RKWard** Auhtors](images/about_authors.png)\n\n![**RKWard** Components](images/about_components.png)\n\n## Initial Window\n\n![Initial Window](images/initial_window.png)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLast update:: 08/25/2023 - 22:59:01 -03\n",
